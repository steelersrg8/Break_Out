## Overview
**Break Out** is a classic arcade-style game developed in Unity using C#. The goal is to break all the bricks on the screen using a bouncing ball controlled by a paddle. This project serves as a hands-on exercise in game development using Unity, focusing on physics, object interactions, and game design principles.

## Features
- **Simple controls**: Move the paddle left and right to keep the ball in play.
- **Dynamic physics**: Realistic ball and paddle interactions.
- **Multiple levels**: Increasing difficulty with more challenging brick layouts.
- **Score tracking**: Earn points for each brick you break.
- **Sound effects**: Enjoy sound feedback when bricks are hit or the ball is lost.

## Gameplay
- Control the paddle to bounce the ball and break all the bricks.
- The game ends when all bricks are broken or the ball falls below the paddle.
- Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Installation
